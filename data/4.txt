ABSTRACT 
This  paper  addresses  the  H∞  state  feedback  control of  continuous 
Markov  jump  LPV  systems.  A  separating  technique  is  employed 
to  tackle  the  coupling  among  Lyapunov  variable,  system  matrix,   
and  controller  parameter.  Worst-case  analysis  is  used  for  LPV 
systems  to  design  gain-scheduled  controllers.  Based  on  these 
strategies, new sufficient conditions for the closed-loop system to 
be stochastically  stable are  formulated in the framework of linear 
matrix  inequalities.  Finally,  the  derived  stabilization  condition  is 
applied to the control of a four-freedom active magnetic bearing.

1 INTRODUCTION   
Compared  with  conventional  mechanical  bearings,  magnetic 
bearings (MBs) possess several remarkable advantages, such as no 
friction  and  wear,  no  need  of  lubrication,  long  life  span,  high 
potential  of  high  control  precision,  as  well  as  the  ability  of 
long-term  high  speed  running  [1].  Therefore,  MBs  have  been 
attracting  considerable  interests  in  various  high-performance 
applications  including  flywheel  energy  and  storage  devices, 
bearingless  motors,  artificial  heart  pumps,  vacuum  pumps, 
numerical  control  machines,  especially  in  special  high-purity 
applications. As a traditional control scheme, the proportional plus 
integral  plus  differential  (PID)  control  scheme  has  been  already 
applied  in  the  MB  system  in  a  general  way  owing  to  its  simple 
realization  [2].  However,  the  control  performance  of  the  MB 
system by using the conventional PID control scheme could not be 
very satisfied owing to the unmeasured parameters variations and 
unavoidable

development  of  modern  control  theories,  all  kinds  of  advanced 
control  methods  have  been  recently  proposed  for  MB  systems  in

control,  sliding  mode  control,  predictive  control,  robust  control,

aforementioned  nonlinear 

Besides 
the 
linearization  and  decoupling  control  schemes  have  been  widely 
employed for MB systems in recent years [7]. However, all these 
control  methods  were  carried  out  at  a  specific  speed  of  MBs. 
There is no research focused on the stability control of MBs under 
full speed range. 

Markov jump systems (MJSs) belong to the category of stochastic 
hybrid systems with state and jump mode modeled by differential 
equations.  A  great  deal  of  effort  has  been  made  to  research  the 
analysis  and  synthesis  of  MJSs  [8–9],  and  the  involved  results 
have  been  successfully  applied 
to  a  variety  of  practical 
applications,  such  as  fault-tolerant  systems,  biology  systems, 
distributed  network  systems,  robotic  manipulator  systems  and 
wireless  communication  systems  .  As  an  application  field,  under 
the  full  speed  range,  the  MBs  model  can  be  established  as  a 
Markov  jump  system.  Since  different  speed    causes  different 
unbalanced  vibration  and  gyro  effect,  thus,  considering  the  MB 
speed is essentially needed. Accordingly, this paper deals with the 
MB  stability  problem  by  modeling  it  with  some  measurable 
time-varying parameters coupled with multiple switchable modes. 
Subsequently,  by  establishing  the  time-varying  parameters  for 
each  mode,  the  real-  time  information  on  the  speed  is  exactly 
applied  to  the  control  of  Markov  jump  linear  parameter-varying 
(MJLPV) systems. 

In this paper, we further consider the H ∞ state feedback control of 
MJLPV  systems  for 
the  active  magnetic  bearing  system. 
Considering  the  unbalanced  vibration  and  gyro  effect,  the  MB 
model  was  described  as  an  MJS mode.  Then  the  coupling  among 
controller gains and system matrices is removed by a constructive 
method.  To  make  the  closed-loop  system  be  stochastically  stable 
with a prescribed H ∞ performance index, sufficient conditions are 
established  by  means  of  linear  matrix  inequalities.  Finally,  a 
numerical MB example is provided to demonstrate the validity of 
the established results.

2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND 
PRELIMINARIES   

Let us consider the following MJLPV system:   

        (1) 

Where  x(t) ∈  Rn is  the  state  vector  of  the  system;  u(t) ∈Rm  is 
control input; z(t) ∈Rp is controlled output; ω(t) ∈Rq is the noise 
signal which is assumed to be an arbitrary signal; A(rt,θ(t)), B(rt), 
C(rt)  and  F(rt)  are  system  matrices;  θ(t)  denotes  the time  varying 
parameter satisfying that 

rt is a continuous Markov process and takes values in I = {1, 2, ..., 
s} and satisfies

matrix is 

 

For notation simplicity, when rt = i, the system matrices of the ith 
mode can be simplified as Ai , Bi, Ci, and Fi . This paper aims at 
designing a state-feedback controller 

 

                                                          (2) 

such that the following closed-loop system

Moreover,  the  controller  gain  matrix  Ki  can  be  calculated  as

Proof:  Consider  the  following  Lyapunov–Krasovskii  functional 
candidate: 

Then the derivative of V(t,i) is 

 

 
Considering  the H ∞  performance  γ  under  zero  initial  conditions 
for any nonzero  ω(t), the system (3) is stochastically stable if the

to be stochastically stable and meets the required H ∞  performance 
level γ. 
Before ending this section, the definition of stochastic stability and 
technical lemmas are given as follows: 

Definition 1 [10]. System (1) is said to be stochastically stable if, 
when u (t) = 0 , for any finite  ψ(t)  ∈  R n defined on [  −τ, 0] , 
and r 0  ∈  S the following condition is satisfied 

Lemma 1 [10]. For given matrices H , F ( t ) and E of appropriate 
dimensions with F ( t ) satisfying F ( t ) T F ( t ) ≤I , for any λ> 0 
the following inequality holds 

 

HF (t) E + E T F (t) H T ≤λH H T + λ−1 E T E 

Lemma 2 [10]. The following two inequalities are equivalent:   
(a)  there  exists  a  symmetric  and  positive-definite  matrix  P 
satisfying 

(b)  there  exists  a  symmetric  and  positive-definite  matrix  P  and 
matrix X satisfying 

 

 

3 MAIN RESULTS   
In  this  section,  with  the  assumption  of  known  TPs,  sufficient 
conditions  for  the  closed-loop  system  (3)  to  be  stochastically 
stable are presented in Theorem 1 . 

Theorem  1.  The  closed-loop  system  (3)  with  known    transition 
probabilities    is stochastically stable and meets the required H  ∞ 
performance index γ, if there exist symmetric and positive definite 
matrices Pi and matrices J, Zi , Ni satisfying the following LMIs:

According to Lemma 1 , the following inequality holds

        By Newton's second law, the dynamic model of 4-DOF AMB 
system can be obtained according to its structure as follows:

If the Ai(θ) in the LPV systems linear affine depends on parameter 
θ, (9) can be equivalent to (4) and (5) . Consequently, the system 
(3) is stochastically stable with the required H ∞ performance once 
(4) and (5) hold.     

4. APPLICATION TO ACTIVE MAGNETIC 
BEARING 
In  this  paper,  the  rotor  of  the  MB  is  assumed  to  be  a  rigid  and 
symmetric  body.  Fig.1  shows  the  relationship  of  the  coordinate 
system  and  the  rotor  forces  of  the  4-degree  of  freedom  (DOF) 
AMBs. In Fig.1, O is the geometrical center of the rotor; Ol and Or 
denote  the  two  centers  of  the  two  2-DOF  radial  AMBs, 
respectively;  xa,  xb  and  ya,  yb  are  the  radial  displacements  in  X- 
and  Y-axes,  respectively;  θ x  and  θ y  are  the  rotor  angular 
displacements about the X- and Y-axes, respectively; Fxa, Fxb, Fya, 
and Fyb  are  the  radial  AMB  forces  along the  aX–,  bX–,  aY–,  and 
bY–  axes,  respectively;  ω  is  the  rotational  mechanical  speed  of 
the  rotor.  Fex  (Fey)  and  Mεx (Mεy)  are  the  unbalanced  forces  and 
unbalanced moments of the rotor in the x (y) directions.   

where m is the mass of the rotor; g is the gravity constant; la and 
lb are the distance from O to the centers of the two 2-DOF radial 
AMB, respectively; Jx, Jy, and Jz are the moments of inertia of the 
rotor  in  the  X–,  Y–,  and  Z–axes,  respectively,  and  Jx=Jy; 

; 

;  ki 
and  ks  are  current  stiffness  coefficient  and  displacement  stiffness 
coefficient.   

; 

;

According  to  the  system  matrix  differential  equation described  in 
equation  above,  we  can  get  the  state  space  description  of  the 
magnetic bearing rotor with respect to the state variable X , Input 
variable  u  and  disturbance  variable  v  .  The  state  space  of  the 
system is described as

From  formula  (10)  we  can  see  that  the  unbalanced  vibration  and 
gyro  effect  are  functions  of  the  speed.  So  corresponding  to  the 
three  modes,  the  speed  can  be  divided  into  low  speed,  medium 
speed and high speed.   

To  verify  the  proposed  control  scheme  for  the  4-DOF  AMB 
system, some simulation studies are carried out under the speed of 
0~40000r/min.  With  different  speed  range,  the  A  and  E  in 
equation  (10)  are  varied  using  the  worst-case  analysis  of  LPV. 

Table  1  illustrates  the  system  parameters,  and  Fig.  2-3  show  the 
photograph  of  the  simulation  results  as  well  as  the  parameters  of 
the control schemes.

From  Fig.  3,  it  is  seen  that  the  MB  system  (10)  is 

stochastically stable and meets the required H ∞ performance with       
γ=1.4235, v(t) = 0.2sin (t) , K1、K2 and K3. 

   

5. CONCLUSION 
H  ∞  control of MJLPV is discussed in this paper. Since a scaling 
method is developed to deal with controller design, how to reduce 
the induced scaling conservativeness needs further research.

In  this  paper,  the  rotor  of  the  MB  is  assumed  to  be  a  rigid  and 
symmetric  body.  Fig.1  shows  the  relationship  of  the  coordinate 
system  and  the  rotor  forces  of  the  4-degree  of  freedom  (DOF) 
AMBs. In Fig.1, O is the geometrical center of the rotor; Ol and Or 
denote  the  two  centers  of  the  two  2-DOF  radial  AMBs, 
respectively;  xa,  xb  and  ya,  yb  are  the  radial  displacements  in  X- 
and  Y-axes,  respectively;  θ x  and  θ y  are  the  rotor  angular 
displacements about the X- and Y-axes, respectively; Fxa, Fxb, Fya, 
and Fyb  are  the  radial  AMB  forces  along the  aX–,  bX–,  aY–,  and 
bY–  axes,  respectively;  ω  is  the  rotational  mechanical  speed  of 
the  rotor.  Fex  (Fey)  and  Mεx (Mεy)  are  the  unbalanced  forces  and 
unbalanced moments of the rotor in the x (y) directions.

lb are the distance from O to the centers of the two 2-DOF radial 
AMB, respectively; Jx, Jy, and Jz are the moments of inertia of the 
rotor  in  the  X–,  Y–,  and  Z–axes,  respectively,  and  Jx=Jy;

From  formula  (10)  we  can  see  that  the  unbalanced  vibration  and

To  verify  the  proposed  control  scheme  for  the  4-DOF  AMB 
system, some simulation studies are carried out under the speed of 
0~40000r/min.  With  different  speed  range,  the  A  and  E  in

ABSTRACT 
This  paper  addresses  the  H∞  state  feedback  control of  continuous 
Markov  jump  LPV  systems.  A  separating  technique  is  employed 
to  tackle  the  coupling  among  Lyapunov  variable,  system  matrix,   
and  controller  parameter.  Worst-case  analysis  is  used  for  LPV 
systems  to  design  gain-scheduled  controllers.  Based  on  these 
strategies, new sufficient conditions for the closed-loop system to 
be stochastically  stable are  formulated in the framework of linear 
matrix  inequalities.  Finally,  the  derived  stabilization  condition  is 
applied to the control of a four-freedom active magnetic bearing.

1 INTRODUCTION   
Compared  with  conventional  mechanical  bearings,  magnetic 
bearings (MBs) possess several remarkable advantages, such as no 
friction  and  wear,  no  need  of  lubrication,  long  life  span,  high 
potential  of  high  control  precision,  as  well  as  the  ability  of 
long-term  high  speed  running  [1].  Therefore,  MBs  have  been 
attracting  considerable  interests  in  various  high-performance 
applications  including  flywheel  energy  and  storage  devices, 
bearingless  motors,  artificial  heart  pumps,  vacuum  pumps, 
numerical  control  machines,  especially  in  special  high-purity 
applications. As a traditional control scheme, the proportional plus 
integral  plus  differential  (PID)  control  scheme  has  been  already 
applied  in  the  MB  system  in  a  general  way  owing  to  its  simple 
realization  [2].  However,  the  control  performance  of  the  MB 
system by using the conventional PID control scheme could not be 
very satisfied owing to the unmeasured parameters variations and 
unavoidable 
the 
development  of  modern  control  theories,  all  kinds  of  advanced 
control  methods  have  been  recently  proposed  for  MB  systems  in 
[3-6] and the references therein, such as fuzzy control, intelligent 
control,  sliding  mode  control,  predictive  control,  robust  control, 

disturbances.  Therefore,  with

adaptive  control,  fractional  order  control,  back-stepping  control, 
optimum control. These advanced control methods not only enrich 
the  control  theory  of  MB  systems  but  also  improve  their 
performance in different aspects.   

control  methods, 

aforementioned  nonlinear 

Besides 
the 
linearization  and  decoupling  control  schemes  have  been  widely 
employed for MB systems in recent years [7]. However, all these 
control  methods  were  carried  out  at  a  specific  speed  of  MBs. 
There is no research focused on the stability control of MBs under 
full speed range. 

Markov jump systems (MJSs) belong to the category of stochastic 
hybrid systems with state and jump mode modeled by differential 
equations.  A  great  deal  of  effort  has  been  made  to  research  the 
analysis  and  synthesis  of  MJSs  [8–9],  and  the  involved  results 
have  been  successfully  applied 
to  a  variety  of  practical 
applications,  such  as  fault-tolerant  systems,  biology  systems, 
distributed  network  systems,  robotic  manipulator  systems  and 
wireless  communication  systems  .  As  an  application  field,  under 
the  full  speed  range,  the  MBs  model  can  be  established  as  a 
Markov  jump  system.  Since  different  speed    causes  different 
unbalanced  vibration  and  gyro  effect,  thus,  considering  the  MB 
speed is essentially needed. Accordingly, this paper deals with the 
MB  stability  problem  by  modeling  it  with  some  measurable 
time-varying parameters coupled with multiple switchable modes. 
Subsequently,  by  establishing  the  time-varying  parameters  for 
each  mode,  the  real-  time  information  on  the  speed  is  exactly 
applied  to  the  control  of  Markov  jump  linear  parameter-varying 
(MJLPV) systems. 

In this paper, we further consider the H ∞ state feedback control of 
MJLPV  systems  for 
the  active  magnetic  bearing  system. 
Considering  the  unbalanced  vibration  and  gyro  effect,  the  MB 
model  was  described  as  an  MJS mode.  Then  the  coupling  among 
controller gains and system matrices is removed by a constructive 
method.  To  make  the  closed-loop  system  be  stochastically  stable 
with a prescribed H ∞ performance index, sufficient conditions are 
established  by  means  of  linear  matrix  inequalities.  Finally,  a 
numerical MB example is provided to demonstrate the validity of 
the established results.
