ABSTRACT 

The  world  of  simulation  involve  the  generation  of  several  independent  simulated  data  sets.  These 
generated data sets must also be completely independent for the different scenarios considered, such as, in 
the presence of censored data. Designing high-quality simulations that reflect the complex models seen in 
practice, such as in failures prognostic studies, sometimes is an hard process. In our PhD work, we intend 
to contribute in the way of design and programming algorithms that generate correctly, robust  and non-
skewed censored data. The methodology and procedure can be a useful tool in the field of simulation of 
reliability  of  equipment  and  components.  On  the  other  hand,  the  purpose  of  this  presentation  in  PhD 
colloquium,  is  to  expose  the  first  part  of  PhD,  that  develop  a  methodology  and  a  procedure  based  in 
algorithms made in an open-source software – R: a programming language and free software environment 
for statistical computing.

INTRODUCTION 

Simulation  studies  should  be  designed  with  rigor,  similar  to  the  study  of  real  data,  since  they  should 
represent the results of real events. Simulating data sets requires an assumed distribution for the data and 
full specification of the required parameters. 

Today  there  is  a  lot  of  simulation  studies  in  reliability  censor  data  using  Weibull  and  other 
distributions,  unfortunately,  in  very  few  published  simulation  studies,  on  reliability,  sufficient  detail  is 
provided  to  assess  the  integrity  of  the  study  design  or  to  allow  readers  to  fully  understand  all  the 
processes  required  when  designing  their  own  simulation  study,  and  explain  how  they  have  done  the 
simulation and how generate the random number. 

Random numbers are the essential basis of the simulation. Usually, all the randomness involved in the 
model  is  obtained  from  a  random  number  generator,  that  produces  a  succession  of  values  that  are 
supposed  to  be  realizations  of  a  sequence  of  independent  and  identically  distributed  (i.i.d.)  random 
variables, L’Ecuyer (2012). 

These  random  numbers  are  then  conveniently  transformed  to  simulate  the  different  probability 
distributions that are required in the model. In general, the validity of the transformation methods depends 
strongly on the hypothesis that the starting values are realizations of random variables i.i.d. U(0,1). 

To decide whether a given sequence is “truely” random, or independent and identically distributed, it 
is  necessary  to  use  non-parametric  tests  for  randomness.  Combining  the  decisions  made  by  each  test, 
improves the confidence on the randomness of a given sequence. 

The  data  is  considered  complete  when  it  is  known  the  exact  time  of  each  system  failure.  In  many 
cases the data contain uncertainties, i.e., it is not known the exact moment when the failure occurred. The 
data  containing  such  uncertainty  as  to  when  the  event  occurred  are  regarded  as  incomplete  or  partial. 
Incomplete  data  give  only  part  of  the  information  about  the  failure  time  of  the  units  under  review, 
truncated  Gijbels  (2010).  However,  this  information  should  not  be  ignored  or  treated  as  failure.  In  the

absence of such data, it would not be possible to make good estimation parameters and after that make a 
proper analysis. 

2  METHODOLOGY 

For each model of censored random data generation, in the first phase, we developed the censored data 
generation  algorithm,  then  we  apply  our  methodology,  which  starts  with  random  number  generation, 
based  on  uniform  distribution,  then  conversion  to  the  distribution  chosen,  as  well  as  the  parameters 
defined.  To  random  number  generating,  it´s  use  the  RNG  "Mersenne-Twister",  from  Matsumoto  and 
Nishimura (1998).  In the next step, is chose a  n dimension of  sample  (1000) to do for each simulation, 
then apply the five randomness tests and for each one we extracted the p-value (for the chosen confidence 
level - 0.05 and 0.1), after that, is made this simulation cycle for m times (1000) and calculate the average 
of the p-values of each distribution. This routine are made for different shape parameters (five) of the five 
statistical  distribution  and  for  six  sample  sizes.  For  each  of  them,  we  use  two  level  of  confidence  and 
different percentage of censorship (5, 10, 20 and 30%); we use the following scheme to do a classification 
in  a  range,  from  1  to  3  in  which  we  have  the  value  3  -  which  means  good  and  accepted,  the  value  2  - 
reasonable and accepted and finally the value 1 - bad and not acceptable. The percentages defined were: 
for 3 of (100-90%); for 2 (90-75%) and for 1 (75-0%). 

 For  this  study  and  analysis,  we  use  the  distributions  that  are  most  used  in  reliability  and 
mantainability:  -    Weibull,  normal,  gamma,  log-normal  and  exponential.  In  each  of  them  we  had  to 
calculate the censorship time for which we would have a reliability of 5, 10, 20 or 30%. The methodology 
and a procedure based in algorithms made in a language, open-source - R a programming language and 
free  software  environment for  statistical  computing  and  graphics  that is  supported  by  the  R  Foundation 
for Statistical Computing, R Development Core Team (2017).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 

The  presentation  permit  to  emphasize,  the  importance  to  test  the  simulation  algorithms  and  show  the 
influence  of  parameters  of  distribution  or  the  parameters  of  model  simulations  (like  that  number  of 
samples or simulations in one cycle) in the randomness of data generation. 

The hypothesis test to apply to the specific generator censor data, have to be select very carefully in 

order to have good results and to optimize the simulation time. 

Ideally,  when  testing  a  model  in  reliability  for  simulation,  there  are  some  difficulties  to  choose  the 
good  RNG  in  combine  with  the  algorithm  to  generate  the  censor  data, because  the  variable  of  practical 
interest can have a bad interference between the RNG and the rest of algorithm of simulation model; the 
results of the simulation model can be biased or not “truely” random. 

The methodology that we use for simulations of the reliability, can be applied in situations of data in 

real time, like equipment autonomous and with artificially intelligent.
