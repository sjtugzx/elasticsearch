ABSTRACT 

Computer  networks  associated  to  more  and  more  interactive 
applications, and mobile interfaces can favor innovative use in the 
field of the scientific and technical practical training. Alternatives 
in the training in traditional such as the remote laboratories can be 
a contribution to solve the problem of the growing numbers of the 
students.  The  Remote 
laboratories  are  flexible,  distributed 
environments which enable a learner to perform real experiments 
via  the  web.  Of  such  facilities  provide  a  practical  education  to 
growing  numbers  of  students,  despite  the  material  resources  and 
supervision  often  limited.  They  can  also  enable  the  sharing  of 
manipulations between several academic institutions nationally or 
internationally, and to enjoy the various partner’s costly resources 
which they would not have access. In a context of strong demand 
of  the  South  countries  for  training  in  the  domain  of  technicians 
and  engineers,  our  project  (rESeau  maghrébIn  de  laboratoirEs  à 
distaNCE,  eSience),  provide  a  response  in  the  Engineering  field. 
In this work, the main objective was to build an interactive system 
to control and manipulate a distance experiences in physics at any 
time with any browser in real-time using a client interface.

The  traditional  teaching  methods  for  students  at  schools  and 
universities  are  obsolete  and  not  effective  enough.  The  students 
often expect higher level teaching methods in the field of physics, 
biology,  chemistry  and  electro-engineering,  which  can help  them 
to perceive real world phenomena in a better way [1].

Remote laboratories refer to a distributed computing environment 
used  as  a distance  education platform.  It  is  flexible,  allowing  the 
student  to  perform  experiments  through  interactions  with  real 
devices and, real instruments, via remotely operated mechanisms.

The  development  of  remote  laboratories  is  a  promising  direction 
for  the  future  of  engineering  education  because  they  provide 
means for students to design and conduct experiments without the 
need for physical laboratories equipment on site. 
Internet technologies and software applications (such as National 
Instrument’s  LabVIEW,  which  is  considered  as  the  leading 
professional  software  for  analysis,  data  acquisition,  real-time 
control and remote laboratories) have had an enormous impact on

3.1.1.  Architecture 

ELAB  FSBM  is  the  remote  laboratories  in  physics,  which  we 
developed in the Faculty of Sciences Ben M'sik in Casablanca. 
The  Remote  laboratories  are  flexible,  distributed  environments, 
which  enable  a  learner  to  perform  real  experiments  via  the  web. 
The  learner  carries  out  the  experiment  and  takes  measurements 
online,  but  he  or  she  can  recover  the  real,  rather  than  simulated, 
experimental  results  in  order  to  utilize  them.  Each  participant 
plays  a  role  during  his  or  her  interactions  with  other  laboratories 
participants,  allowing  all  participants  to  share  in  hardware 
resources and in one another’s expertise [7]. A remote laboratory 
can be built according to the   following diagram (Fig. 2): 

Figure 2: The architecture of the remote laboratories 

 

 

Figure 1: e-Sience community 

 
The  e-Sience  project,  coordinated  by  the  University  Bordeaux 
associate  16  academic  and  industrial  partners  of  North  Africans 
countries  (Morocco,  Tunisia,  Algeria)  and  Europeans  (France, 
Greece, Austria and Romania). 
 This  network  of  remote  laboratories  has  the  objective  of 
modernization  of  higher  education  in  science  and  technology 
should fit characteristics like:  
•  Adaptation  of  content  to  the  development  in  science  and 
technology,  taking  into        account  the  expectations  of  the 
professional world; 
• Implementation of practical courses for on distance education; 
• Creating teaching units in the eLearning format; 
• Setting up and using an LMS (Learning Management System);  
• Evaluation of the newly created educational resources;  
• Use of the pedagogical resources [5, 6].

The  Interactive  Lab  Server  is  the  component  that  is  connected 
directly  to  the  lab  equipment  and  deals  with  the  actual  operation 
of  the  experiment  hardware.  It  is  the  administrative  interface  of 
the lab equipment and enables laboratory administrators to set up 
and  configure  each  experiment  independently  [16,  18,  19].  The 
Interactive  Service  Broker  is  the  heart  of  the  ISA.  It  provides 
generic 
authentication, 
authorization, user management,  and scheduling and data storage 
[8].

instrument.  The  response  of 

 
Remote  access  to  the  instrumentation  can  then  be  performed  in 
three different ways. 
      The  first  one  takes  place  directly  from  the  control  PC.  The 
control  can  be  local  via  a  General  Purpose  Interface  Bus  (GPIB) 
bus,  and  interfaced  to  the  PC  via  a  PCI  expansion  card.  The 
distance  being  then  limited  by  the  maximum  length  of  the  GPIB 
connection  this  is  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the  tens  of 
metersThe  control  can  be  remotely  connected  via  the  LAN  to  a 
LAN-GPIB  interface  box.  GPIB  requests  are  encapsulated  in  the 
Ethernet  frames  and  then  delivered  to  the  interface  box  that 
communicates  with 
the 
instrument to these requests follows the opposite path. The control 
PC  must  have  the  software  drivers  required  for  communication 
with the PCI card or the LAN-GPIB enclosure and the LabVIEW 
application used for the design of virtual instruments. 
the 
    The  second  way 
instrumentation  is  to  use  a  PC  where  only  the  LabVIEW 
application  is  installed,  excluding  any  specific  driver.  LabVIEW 
integrates  natively  all  the  software  components  that  allow  you  to 
connect  through  the  LAN  to  a  virtual  instrument  loaded  into  the 
RAM  of  the  control  PC.  Communication  is  established  through 
the network with the "Connect to remote panel" function. All the 
functions of the virtual instrument loaded into the memory of the 
control  machine  are  accessible.  Communication  with 
the 
measuring  instruments  is  entrusted  to  the  control  PC.  No  special 
software drivers are required. 
    The  third  way  to  communicate  does  not  require  a  physical 
connection with the instrumentation or the installation of specific 
drivers  like  the  machine  control,  or  the  LabVIEW  application  as 
outlined in the previous case, but a standard web browser, such as 
Internet  Explorer  or  Mozilla,  associated  with  a  "plug-in" 
available.  The  installation  of  the  latter,  however,  requires 
administrative rights for Windows 2000 or XP machine type. For 
Internet  Explorer,  this  is  LVActiveXControl.dll.  As  for  Mozilla, 
the  plugin  is  denominated  NPLVWin32.dll.  Both  must  be  in  the 
subdirectory  "Plugins"  of  the  respective  installation  directories 
browsers.  They  are  available  as  a  software  package  called 
"LabVIEW  Run-Time  Engine"  and  available  on  the  platforms 
Macintosh,  Windows  and  Linux,  which  ensures  universality  for 
remote access [9-11, 17]. 
LabVIEW installed on the PC control, has its own Web server on 
which  one  can  come 
the  remote  PC, 
conventionally with a standard web browser. The functions “web 
server”  and  “lab  server”  are  hosted  on  the  same  machine.  GPIB 
requests  are  encapsulated  in  the  HTTP  protocol,  sent  to  the 
control PC, decoded and transmitted to the virtual instrument. The 
measuring  device  response  to  these  requests  follows  the  reverse 
path.  The  front  of  the  instrument  is  loaded  only  once,  at  the 
opening  of  the  corresponding  web  page.  Then,  only  the  requests 
and  the  corresponding  responses  are  transported  on  the  network, 
which limits the traffic to the strict minimum. 
In  this  work,  we  present  the  different  experiences  that  we  have 
(laboratory  of

Casablanca, so that they can be accessed remotely. 

3.2  RC-Circuit  

3.2.1  Description of the experience 

In  this  experiment,  we  will  study  charging  a  capacitor  by 
connecting it to an emf source through a resistor. The experiment 
also  includes  the  study  of  discharging  phenomena  of  a  capacitor 
through a resistor [12, 13]. 

Figure 4: RC Circuit 

 

Objectives: 

•  To  study  charging  and  discharging  process  through 

capacitors. 

•  To determine the time constant τ of an RC-circuit. 

In this work, the main objective was to build an interactive system 
to  determine  the  synchronous  reactance  at  any  time  with  any 
browser  in  real-time  using  a  client  interface  implemented  using 
National  Instrument’s  LabVIEW  and  deployed  as  an  interactive 
lab. 

3.2.2  Hardware Part 

The  hardware  part  of  our  remote  experience  (Fig  6)  contains  a 
Sensor  CASSY,  resistances,  capacitors,  Lab  Server,  and  IP 
Webcam. 
The LabVIEW software and the entire modules are installed in the 
Host  Computer  (E-LAB  FSBM  Lab  Server)  that  controls  the 
whole  system.    The  host  computer  communicates  synchronously 
with  the  chassis  over  a  TCP/IP  connection,  a  real-time  controller 
implements the major complicated algorithms.

Figure 6: Mounting experience 

 
The  real-time  controller  consists of  an  industrial PC  that  reliably 
and  deterministically  executes  LabVIEW  real-time  applications 
and  offers  multi-rate  control,  execution  tracing,  onboard  data 
logging, and communication with peripherals [10]. It receives the 
data  from  the  Sensor  CASSY,  executes  the  control  algorithms, 
and  sends  the  data  to  the  in  real-time.  And  an  IP  Webcam  was 
used to provide real-time viewing experience. The Lab server and 
the  IP  Webcam  were  connected  to  the  Internet  through  a  router 
switch. 

3.2.3 

Software part 

The  software  was  hosted  on  the  web  server  application  using 
LabVIEW.  It  provides  communication  through  TCP\IP  sockets 
with  clients.  The  user  received  commands  and  parameters 
necessary  for  measurement  readings  and  transmuted  the  results. 
Through another module, it communicated with the capture card. 
The  user  interface  allowed  control  and  monitoring  of  client 
connections.  
Client side, the server application, provided the anticipated result 
of  the  experiment.  It  was  documented  in  the  form  of  a  user’s 
manual and it provided both theoretical background and guidance.  
 

3.3  Velocity of Sound in Air 

3.3.1  Description of the experience 

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the velocity of 
sound  in  air  by  measuring  the  time  delay  between  an  ultrasound 
transmitter  and  a  receiver  placed  successively  at  different 
distances as shown in Figure 7.

3.3.2  Hardware Part 

To  adapt  the  experiment  so  that  it  can  be  handled  remotely,  we 
needed  to  make  changes  to  the hardware.  First,  the transmitter  is 
kept in a fixed position and the receptor was used a stepper motor 
to vary the distance between the transmitter and the receiver of 13 
cm to 47 cm.  
For  measurement  and  control  operations,  we  used  a  data 
acquisition card based microcontroller family of  microcontrollers 
(PIC16F876). The latter, controlled by 20 MHz quartz, produced a 
time  base  for  the  measurement  intervals  and  provided  the 
counting operation, it also provided control of the stepping motor 
through a power interface. The card also facilitated asynchronous 
serial  communications  with  the  server  in  order  to  receive  and 
transmit measurements of parameters for the results (Figure 8). 
 

Figure 8: Control card 

In  addition  to  this  card,  an  IP  camera  was  used  to  provide  real-
time  viewing  experience.  The  server  and  the  camera  were 
connected to the Internet through a router switch.

3.3.3 

Software part 

The software  was hosted on the web server application. The web 
server  application  was  developed  using  LabVIEW.  It  provided 
communication through TCP\IP sockets with clients.   
The  user  received  commands  and  parameters  necessary  for 
measurement  readings  and  transmuted  the  results.  Through 
another module, it communicated with the capture card. The user 
interface allowed control and monitoring of client connections. 
Client side, the server application, provided the anticipated result 
of  the  experiment.  It  was  documented  in  the  form  of  a  user’s 
manual and it provided both theoretical background and guidance. 
It  was  delivered  through  HTML  pages  in  Internet  Explorer, 
Mozilla  Firefox,  For  accuracy  of  the  movement  of  receptor,  the 
motor moves at a pitch of 7, 5 cm. 

 

Figure 9: Client Interface 

 

For  manipulation  of  the  experience,  students  can  first  choose  a 
position  of  the  receiver  and  click  ok,  automatically  the  receiver 
will  move  to  the  indicated  position,  and  the  result  will  be 
displayed  on  the  graph  next  to  it.  After  they  determine  the  time 
between  the  transmitter  and  receiver  signal  to  calculate  the 
velocity of sound. 
For example: 
We chose the position 2 which means that d = 30 cm  
And from the graph (Figure 10), T = 0.0009 s

        = 0,31/0,0009 
        = 344,44 m/s 
 
The  students  browse  the  service  broker  to  register  and  request 
membership to the group associated with the laboratory. 
This  procedure  allows  permission  and  access  to  the  booking 
system,  and  then  they  choose  the  available  lab  experiment  to 
launch it. 

4.  CONCLUSION  

The  main  objective  of  this  project  was  to  create  an  effective 
remote laboratory network in the Maghreb region. 
This  work  presented  the  LabVIEW-based  realization  of  a  remote 
laboratories  dedicated  to  students  in  distance  e-sience  group  to 
enable  them  to  manipulate  and  control  in  real  time  the  deferent 
experiences. 
The  feasibility  of  accessing  a  remote  laboratory  from  a  simple 
Internet  browser  has  been  demonstrated.  This  concept 
is 
particularly  interesting  for  several  reasons  since  it  allows: 
eliminating 
through  affording 
flexibility,  affording  the  opportunity  for  conducting  an  online 
experiment  with  real  equipment  anytime  and  anywhere,  and  the 
sharing  of  scarce  and  expensive  resources  between  laboratories 
and educational institutions.

The  traditional  teaching  methods  for  students  at  schools  and 
universities  are  obsolete  and  not  effective  enough.  The  students 
often expect higher level teaching methods in the field of physics, 
biology,  chemistry  and  electro-engineering,  which  can help  them 
to perceive real world phenomena in a better way [1].

Remote laboratories refer to a distributed computing environment 
used  as  a distance  education platform.  It  is  flexible,  allowing  the 
student  to  perform  experiments  through  interactions  with  real 
devices and, real instruments, via remotely operated mechanisms.

The  development  of  remote  laboratories  is  a  promising  direction 
for  the  future  of  engineering  education  because  they  provide 
means for students to design and conduct experiments without the 
need for physical laboratories equipment on site. 
Internet technologies and software applications (such as National 
Instrument’s  LabVIEW,  which  is  considered  as  the  leading 
professional  software  for  analysis,  data  acquisition,  real-time 
control and remote laboratories) have had an enormous impact on

3.1.1.  Architecture 

ELAB  FSBM  is  the  remote  laboratories  in  physics,  which  we 
developed in the Faculty of Sciences Ben M'sik in Casablanca. 
The  Remote  laboratories  are  flexible,  distributed  environments, 
which  enable  a  learner  to  perform  real  experiments  via  the  web. 
The  learner  carries  out  the  experiment  and  takes  measurements 
online,  but  he  or  she  can  recover  the  real,  rather  than  simulated, 
experimental  results  in  order  to  utilize  them.  Each  participant 
plays  a  role  during  his  or  her  interactions  with  other  laboratories 
participants,  allowing  all  participants  to  share  in  hardware 
resources and in one another’s expertise [7]. A remote laboratory 
can be built according to the   following diagram (Fig. 2): 

Figure 2: The architecture of the remote laboratories 

 

 

Figure 1: e-Sience community 

 
The  e-Sience  project,  coordinated  by  the  University  Bordeaux 
associate  16  academic  and  industrial  partners  of  North  Africans 
countries  (Morocco,  Tunisia,  Algeria)  and  Europeans  (France, 
Greece, Austria and Romania). 
 This  network  of  remote  laboratories  has  the  objective  of 
modernization  of  higher  education  in  science  and  technology 
should fit characteristics like:  
•  Adaptation  of  content  to  the  development  in  science  and 
technology,  taking  into        account  the  expectations  of  the 
professional world; 
• Implementation of practical courses for on distance education; 
• Creating teaching units in the eLearning format; 
• Setting up and using an LMS (Learning Management System);  
• Evaluation of the newly created educational resources;  
• Use of the pedagogical resources [5, 6].

The  Interactive  Lab  Server  is  the  component  that  is  connected 
directly  to  the  lab  equipment  and  deals  with  the  actual  operation 
of  the  experiment  hardware.  It  is  the  administrative  interface  of 
the lab equipment and enables laboratory administrators to set up 
and  configure  each  experiment  independently  [16,  18,  19].  The 
Interactive  Service  Broker  is  the  heart  of  the  ISA.  It  provides 
generic 
authentication, 
authorization, user management,  and scheduling and data storage

instrument.  The  response  of 

 
Remote  access  to  the  instrumentation  can  then  be  performed  in 
three different ways. 
      The  first  one  takes  place  directly  from  the  control  PC.  The 
control  can  be  local  via  a  General  Purpose  Interface  Bus  (GPIB) 
bus,  and  interfaced  to  the  PC  via  a  PCI  expansion  card.  The 
distance  being  then  limited  by  the  maximum  length  of  the  GPIB 
connection  this  is  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the  tens  of 
metersThe  control  can  be  remotely  connected  via  the  LAN  to  a 
LAN-GPIB  interface  box.  GPIB  requests  are  encapsulated  in  the 
Ethernet  frames  and  then  delivered  to  the  interface  box  that 
communicates  with 
the 
instrument to these requests follows the opposite path. The control 
PC  must  have  the  software  drivers  required  for  communication 
with the PCI card or the LAN-GPIB enclosure and the LabVIEW 
application used for the design of virtual instruments. 
the 
    The  second  way 
instrumentation  is  to  use  a  PC  where  only  the  LabVIEW 
application  is  installed,  excluding  any  specific  driver.  LabVIEW 
integrates  natively  all  the  software  components  that  allow  you  to 
connect  through  the  LAN  to  a  virtual  instrument  loaded  into  the 
RAM  of  the  control  PC.  Communication  is  established  through 
the network with the "Connect to remote panel" function. All the 
functions of the virtual instrument loaded into the memory of the 
control  machine  are  accessible.  Communication  with 
the 
measuring  instruments  is  entrusted  to  the  control  PC.  No  special 
software drivers are required. 
    The  third  way  to  communicate  does  not  require  a  physical 
connection with the instrumentation or the installation of specific 
drivers  like  the  machine  control,  or  the  LabVIEW  application  as 
outlined in the previous case, but a standard web browser, such as 
Internet  Explorer  or  Mozilla,  associated  with  a  "plug-in" 
available.  The  installation  of  the  latter,  however,  requires 
administrative rights for Windows 2000 or XP machine type. For 
Internet  Explorer,  this  is  LVActiveXControl.dll.  As  for  Mozilla, 
the  plugin  is  denominated  NPLVWin32.dll.  Both  must  be  in  the 
subdirectory  "Plugins"  of  the  respective  installation  directories 
browsers.  They  are  available  as  a  software  package  called 
"LabVIEW  Run-Time  Engine"  and  available  on  the  platforms 
Macintosh,  Windows  and  Linux,  which  ensures  universality  for 
remote access [9-11, 17]. 
LabVIEW installed on the PC control, has its own Web server on 
which  one  can  come 
the  remote  PC, 
conventionally with a standard web browser. The functions “web 
server”  and  “lab  server”  are  hosted  on  the  same  machine.  GPIB 
requests  are  encapsulated  in  the  HTTP  protocol,  sent  to  the 
control PC, decoded and transmitted to the virtual instrument. The 
measuring  device  response  to  these  requests  follows  the  reverse 
path.  The  front  of  the  instrument  is  loaded  only  once,  at  the 
opening  of  the  corresponding  web  page.  Then,  only  the  requests 
and  the  corresponding  responses  are  transported  on  the  network, 
which limits the traffic to the strict minimum. 
In  this  work,  we  present  the  different  experiences  that  we  have

3.2  RC-Circuit  

3.2.1  Description of the experience 

In  this  experiment,  we  will  study  charging  a  capacitor  by 
connecting it to an emf source through a resistor. The experiment 
also  includes  the  study  of  discharging  phenomena  of  a  capacitor 
through a resistor [12, 13]. 

Figure 4: RC Circuit 

 

Objectives: 

•  To  study  charging  and  discharging  process  through 

capacitors. 

•  To determine the time constant τ of an RC-circuit. 

In this work, the main objective was to build an interactive system 
to  determine  the  synchronous  reactance  at  any  time  with  any 
browser  in  real-time  using  a  client  interface  implemented  using 
National  Instrument’s  LabVIEW  and  deployed  as  an  interactive 
lab. 

3.2.2  Hardware Part 

The  hardware  part  of  our  remote  experience  (Fig  6)  contains  a 
Sensor  CASSY,  resistances,  capacitors,  Lab  Server,  and  IP 
Webcam. 
The LabVIEW software and the entire modules are installed in the 
Host  Computer  (E-LAB  FSBM  Lab  Server)  that  controls  the 
whole  system.    The  host  computer  communicates  synchronously 
with  the  chassis  over  a  TCP/IP  connection,  a  real-time  controller 
implements the major complicated algorithms.

Figure 6: Mounting experience 

 
The  real-time  controller  consists of  an  industrial PC  that  reliably 
and  deterministically  executes  LabVIEW  real-time  applications 
and  offers  multi-rate  control,  execution  tracing,  onboard  data 
logging, and communication with peripherals [10]. It receives the 
data  from  the  Sensor  CASSY,  executes  the  control  algorithms, 
and  sends  the  data  to  the  in  real-time.  And  an  IP  Webcam  was 
used to provide real-time viewing experience. The Lab server and 
the  IP  Webcam  were  connected  to  the  Internet  through  a  router 
switch. 

3.2.3 

Software part 

The  software  was  hosted  on  the  web  server  application  using 
LabVIEW.  It  provides  communication  through  TCP\IP  sockets 
with  clients.  The  user  received  commands  and  parameters 
necessary  for  measurement  readings  and  transmuted  the  results. 
Through another module, it communicated with the capture card. 
The  user  interface  allowed  control  and  monitoring  of  client 
connections.  
Client side, the server application, provided the anticipated result 
of  the  experiment.  It  was  documented  in  the  form  of  a  user’s 
manual and it provided both theoretical background and guidance.  
 

3.3  Velocity of Sound in Air 

3.3.1  Description of the experience 

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the velocity of 
sound  in  air  by  measuring  the  time  delay  between  an  ultrasound 
transmitter  and  a  receiver  placed  successively  at  different 
distances as shown in Figure 7.

3.3.2  Hardware Part 

To  adapt  the  experiment  so  that  it  can  be  handled  remotely,  we 
needed  to  make  changes  to  the hardware.  First,  the transmitter  is 
kept in a fixed position and the receptor was used a stepper motor 
to vary the distance between the transmitter and the receiver of 13 
cm to 47 cm.  
For  measurement  and  control  operations,  we  used  a  data 
acquisition card based microcontroller family of  microcontrollers 
(PIC16F876). The latter, controlled by 20 MHz quartz, produced a 
time  base  for  the  measurement  intervals  and  provided  the 
counting operation, it also provided control of the stepping motor 
through a power interface. The card also facilitated asynchronous 
serial  communications  with  the  server  in  order  to  receive  and 
transmit measurements of parameters for the results (Figure 8). 
 

Figure 8: Control card 

In  addition  to  this  card,  an  IP  camera  was  used  to  provide  real-
time  viewing  experience.  The  server  and  the  camera  were 
connected to the Internet through a router switch.

3.3.3 

Software part 

The software  was hosted on the web server application. The web 
server  application  was  developed  using  LabVIEW.  It  provided 
communication through TCP\IP sockets with clients.   
The  user  received  commands  and  parameters  necessary  for 
measurement  readings  and  transmuted  the  results.  Through 
another module, it communicated with the capture card. The user 
interface allowed control and monitoring of client connections. 
Client side, the server application, provided the anticipated result 
of  the  experiment.  It  was  documented  in  the  form  of  a  user’s 
manual and it provided both theoretical background and guidance. 
It  was  delivered  through  HTML  pages  in  Internet  Explorer, 
Mozilla  Firefox,  For  accuracy  of  the  movement  of  receptor,  the 
motor moves at a pitch of 7, 5 cm. 

 

Figure 9: Client Interface 

 

For  manipulation  of  the  experience,  students  can  first  choose  a 
position  of  the  receiver  and  click  ok,  automatically  the  receiver 
will  move  to  the  indicated  position,  and  the  result  will  be 
displayed  on  the  graph  next  to  it.  After  they  determine  the  time 
between  the  transmitter  and  receiver  signal  to  calculate  the 
velocity of sound. 
For example: 
We chose the position 2 which means that d = 30 cm  
And from the graph (Figure 10), T = 0.0009 s

        = 344,44 m/s 
 
The  students  browse  the  service  broker  to  register  and  request 
membership to the group associated with the laboratory. 
This  procedure  allows  permission  and  access  to  the  booking 
system,  and  then  they  choose  the  available  lab  experiment  to 
launch it. 

4.  CONCLUSION  

The  main  objective  of  this  project  was  to  create  an  effective 
remote laboratory network in the Maghreb region. 
This  work  presented  the  LabVIEW-based  realization  of  a  remote 
laboratories  dedicated  to  students  in  distance  e-sience  group  to 
enable  them  to  manipulate  and  control  in  real  time  the  deferent 
experiences. 
The  feasibility  of  accessing  a  remote  laboratory  from  a  simple 
Internet  browser  has  been  demonstrated.  This  concept 
is 
particularly  interesting  for  several  reasons  since  it  allows: 
eliminating 
through  affording 
flexibility,  affording  the  opportunity  for  conducting  an  online 
experiment  with  real  equipment  anytime  and  anywhere,  and  the 
sharing  of  scarce  and  expensive  resources  between  laboratories 
and educational institutions.

ABSTRACT 

Computer  networks  associated  to  more  and  more  interactive 
applications, and mobile interfaces can favor innovative use in the 
field of the scientific and technical practical training. Alternatives 
in the training in traditional such as the remote laboratories can be 
a contribution to solve the problem of the growing numbers of the 
students.  The  Remote 
laboratories  are  flexible,  distributed 
environments which enable a learner to perform real experiments 
via  the  web.  Of  such  facilities  provide  a  practical  education  to 
growing  numbers  of  students,  despite  the  material  resources  and 
supervision  often  limited.  They  can  also  enable  the  sharing  of 
manipulations between several academic institutions nationally or 
internationally, and to enjoy the various partner’s costly resources 
which they would not have access. In a context of strong demand 
of  the  South  countries  for  training  in  the  domain  of  technicians 
and  engineers,  our  project  (rESeau  maghrébIn  de  laboratoirEs  à 
distaNCE,  eSience),  provide  a  response  in  the  Engineering  field. 
In this work, the main objective was to build an interactive system 
to control and manipulate a distance experiences in physics at any 
time with any browser in real-time using a client interface.

The  traditional  teaching  methods  for  students  at  schools  and 
universities  are  obsolete  and  not  effective  enough.  The  students 
often expect higher level teaching methods in the field of physics, 
biology,  chemistry  and  electro-engineering,  which  can help  them 
to perceive real world phenomena in a better way [1].

according  to  the  theoretical  courses.    However,  due  to  several 
limiting  factors  in  traditional  laboratory  experiments,  students 
cannot  get  the  necessary  experiences.  Remote  laboratories  for 
instruments control are an important tool for teaching students in 
physics  and  of  control  systems  engineering  and  experimentation 
with a wide range of feedback devices [2]. 
Remote laboratories refer to a distributed computing environment 
used  as  a distance  education platform.  It  is  flexible,  allowing  the 
student  to  perform  experiments  through  interactions  with  real 
devices and, real instruments, via remotely operated mechanisms. 
This  type  of  educational  experience  is  essential  in  scientific  and

experiences  to  students  remotely  meets  real  needs  of  both  the 
students and the universities [14].  
The  development  of  remote  laboratories  is  a  promising  direction 
for  the  future  of  engineering  education  because  they  provide 
means for students to design and conduct experiments without the 
need for physical laboratories equipment on site. 
Internet technologies and software applications (such as National 
Instrument’s  LabVIEW,  which  is  considered  as  the  leading 
professional  software  for  analysis,  data  acquisition,  real-time 
control and remote laboratories) have had an enormous impact on 
engineering education [3].

With  remote  laboratories,  the  interactions  between  the  students 
and  the  reel  instruments  are  facilitated  by  an  appropriate 
communications  platform  which  is  equipped  with  a  system 
dedicated  to  the  management  of  a  number  of  software  and 
hardware  interfaces  [4].  Remote  laboratories  allow  a  practical 
education  to  growing  numbers  of  students,  despite  the  material 
resources and often limited supervision [15]. They can also enable 
the  sharing  of  handling  between  several  academic  institutions 
nationally  or  internationally,  and  to  enjoy  the  various  partner’s 
costly resources which they would not have access. 

2  E-SIENCE PROJECT 

In a context of strong demand of the South countries for training 
in  the  domain  of  technicians  and  engineers,  our  project  (rESeau 
maghrébIn  de  laboratoirEs  à  distaNCE,  eSience)  provide  a 
response in the Engineering field. 
Following the saying "I hear and I forget - I see and I remember. - 
I  do  and  I  understand"  the  project  will  build  on  the  eLearning 
complements 
integrating  practical  work 
remotely, and will train a large number of students.

3.1.1.  Architecture 

ELAB  FSBM  is  the  remote  laboratories  in  physics,  which  we 
developed in the Faculty of Sciences Ben M'sik in Casablanca. 
The  Remote  laboratories  are  flexible,  distributed  environments, 
which  enable  a  learner  to  perform  real  experiments  via  the  web. 
The  learner  carries  out  the  experiment  and  takes  measurements 
online,  but  he  or  she  can  recover  the  real,  rather  than  simulated, 
experimental  results  in  order  to  utilize  them.  Each  participant 
plays  a  role  during  his  or  her  interactions  with  other  laboratories 
participants,  allowing  all  participants  to  share  in  hardware 
resources and in one another’s expertise [7]. A remote laboratory 
can be built according to the   following diagram (Fig. 2): 

Figure 2: The architecture of the remote laboratories 

 

 

Figure 1: e-Sience community 

 
The  e-Sience  project,  coordinated  by  the  University  Bordeaux 
associate  16  academic  and  industrial  partners  of  North  Africans 
countries  (Morocco,  Tunisia,  Algeria)  and  Europeans  (France, 
Greece, Austria and Romania). 
 This  network  of  remote  laboratories  has  the  objective  of 
modernization  of  higher  education  in  science  and  technology 
should fit characteristics like:  
•  Adaptation  of  content  to  the  development  in  science  and 
technology,  taking  into        account  the  expectations  of  the 
professional world; 
• Implementation of practical courses for on distance education; 
• Creating teaching units in the eLearning format; 
• Setting up and using an LMS (Learning Management System);  
• Evaluation of the newly created educational resources;  
• Use of the pedagogical resources [5, 6].

The  Interactive  Lab  Server  is  the  component  that  is  connected 
directly  to  the  lab  equipment  and  deals  with  the  actual  operation 
of  the  experiment  hardware.  It  is  the  administrative  interface  of 
the lab equipment and enables laboratory administrators to set up 
and  configure  each  experiment  independently  [16,  18,  19].  The 
Interactive  Service  Broker  is  the  heart  of  the  ISA.  It  provides 
generic 
authentication, 
authorization, user management,  and scheduling and data storage

instrument.  The  response  of 

 
Remote  access  to  the  instrumentation  can  then  be  performed  in 
three different ways. 
      The  first  one  takes  place  directly  from  the  control  PC.  The 
control  can  be  local  via  a  General  Purpose  Interface  Bus  (GPIB) 
bus,  and  interfaced  to  the  PC  via  a  PCI  expansion  card.  The 
distance  being  then  limited  by  the  maximum  length  of  the  GPIB 
connection  this  is  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the  tens  of 
metersThe  control  can  be  remotely  connected  via  the  LAN  to  a 
LAN-GPIB  interface  box.  GPIB  requests  are  encapsulated  in  the 
Ethernet  frames  and  then  delivered  to  the  interface  box  that 
communicates  with 
the 
instrument to these requests follows the opposite path. The control 
PC  must  have  the  software  drivers  required  for  communication 
with the PCI card or the LAN-GPIB enclosure and the LabVIEW 
application used for the design of virtual instruments. 
the 
    The  second  way 
instrumentation  is  to  use  a  PC  where  only  the  LabVIEW 
application  is  installed,  excluding  any  specific  driver.  LabVIEW 
integrates  natively  all  the  software  components  that  allow  you  to 
connect  through  the  LAN  to  a  virtual  instrument  loaded  into  the 
RAM  of  the  control  PC.  Communication  is  established  through 
the network with the "Connect to remote panel" function. All the 
functions of the virtual instrument loaded into the memory of the 
control  machine  are  accessible.  Communication  with 
the 
measuring  instruments  is  entrusted  to  the  control  PC.  No  special 
software drivers are required. 
    The  third  way  to  communicate  does  not  require  a  physical 
connection with the instrumentation or the installation of specific 
drivers  like  the  machine  control,  or  the  LabVIEW  application  as 
outlined in the previous case, but a standard web browser, such as 
Internet  Explorer  or  Mozilla,  associated  with  a  "plug-in" 
available.  The  installation  of  the  latter,  however,  requires 
administrative rights for Windows 2000 or XP machine type. For 
Internet  Explorer,  this  is  LVActiveXControl.dll.  As  for  Mozilla, 
the  plugin  is  denominated  NPLVWin32.dll.  Both  must  be  in  the 
subdirectory  "Plugins"  of  the  respective  installation  directories 
browsers.  They  are  available  as  a  software  package  called 
"LabVIEW  Run-Time  Engine"  and  available  on  the  platforms 
Macintosh,  Windows  and  Linux,  which  ensures  universality  for 
remote access [9-11, 17]. 
LabVIEW installed on the PC control, has its own Web server on 
which  one  can  come 
the  remote  PC, 
conventionally with a standard web browser. The functions “web 
server”  and  “lab  server”  are  hosted  on  the  same  machine.  GPIB 
requests  are  encapsulated  in  the  HTTP  protocol,  sent  to  the 
control PC, decoded and transmitted to the virtual instrument. The 
measuring  device  response  to  these  requests  follows  the  reverse 
path.  The  front  of  the  instrument  is  loaded  only  once,  at  the 
opening  of  the  corresponding  web  page.  Then,  only  the  requests 
and  the  corresponding  responses  are  transported  on  the  network, 
which limits the traffic to the strict minimum. 
In  this  work,  we  present  the  different  experiences  that  we  have

3.2  RC-Circuit  

3.2.1  Description of the experience 

In  this  experiment,  we  will  study  charging  a  capacitor  by 
connecting it to an emf source through a resistor. The experiment 
also  includes  the  study  of  discharging  phenomena  of  a  capacitor 
through a resistor [12, 13]. 

Figure 4: RC Circuit 

 

Objectives: 

•  To  study  charging  and  discharging  process  through 

capacitors. 

•  To determine the time constant τ of an RC-circuit. 

In this work, the main objective was to build an interactive system 
to  determine  the  synchronous  reactance  at  any  time  with  any 
browser  in  real-time  using  a  client  interface  implemented  using 
National  Instrument’s  LabVIEW  and  deployed  as  an  interactive 
lab. 

3.2.2  Hardware Part 

The  hardware  part  of  our  remote  experience  (Fig  6)  contains  a 
Sensor  CASSY,  resistances,  capacitors,  Lab  Server,  and  IP 
Webcam. 
The LabVIEW software and the entire modules are installed in the 
Host  Computer  (E-LAB  FSBM  Lab  Server)  that  controls  the 
whole  system.    The  host  computer  communicates  synchronously 
with  the  chassis  over  a  TCP/IP  connection,  a  real-time  controller 
implements the major complicated algorithms.

Figure 6: Mounting experience 

 
The  real-time  controller  consists of  an  industrial PC  that  reliably 
and  deterministically  executes  LabVIEW  real-time  applications 
and  offers  multi-rate  control,  execution  tracing,  onboard  data 
logging, and communication with peripherals [10]. It receives the 
data  from  the  Sensor  CASSY,  executes  the  control  algorithms, 
and  sends  the  data  to  the  in  real-time.  And  an  IP  Webcam  was 
used to provide real-time viewing experience. The Lab server and 
the  IP  Webcam  were  connected  to  the  Internet  through  a  router 
switch. 

3.2.3 

Software part 

The  software  was  hosted  on  the  web  server  application  using 
LabVIEW.  It  provides  communication  through  TCP\IP  sockets 
with  clients.  The  user  received  commands  and  parameters 
necessary  for  measurement  readings  and  transmuted  the  results. 
Through another module, it communicated with the capture card. 
The  user  interface  allowed  control  and  monitoring  of  client 
connections.  
Client side, the server application, provided the anticipated result 
of  the  experiment.  It  was  documented  in  the  form  of  a  user’s 
manual and it provided both theoretical background and guidance.  
 

3.3  Velocity of Sound in Air 

3.3.1  Description of the experience 

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the velocity of 
sound  in  air  by  measuring  the  time  delay  between  an  ultrasound 
transmitter  and  a  receiver  placed  successively  at  different 
distances as shown in Figure 7.

3.3.2  Hardware Part 

To  adapt  the  experiment  so  that  it  can  be  handled  remotely,  we 
needed  to  make  changes  to  the hardware.  First,  the transmitter  is 
kept in a fixed position and the receptor was used a stepper motor 
to vary the distance between the transmitter and the receiver of 13 
cm to 47 cm.  
For  measurement  and  control  operations,  we  used  a  data 
acquisition card based microcontroller family of  microcontrollers 
(PIC16F876). The latter, controlled by 20 MHz quartz, produced a 
time  base  for  the  measurement  intervals  and  provided  the 
counting operation, it also provided control of the stepping motor 
through a power interface. The card also facilitated asynchronous 
serial  communications  with  the  server  in  order  to  receive  and 
transmit measurements of parameters for the results (Figure 8). 
 

Figure 8: Control card 

In  addition  to  this  card,  an  IP  camera  was  used  to  provide  real-
time  viewing  experience.  The  server  and  the  camera  were 
connected to the Internet through a router switch.

3.3.3 

Software part 

The software  was hosted on the web server application. The web 
server  application  was  developed  using  LabVIEW.  It  provided 
communication through TCP\IP sockets with clients.   
The  user  received  commands  and  parameters  necessary  for 
measurement  readings  and  transmuted  the  results.  Through 
another module, it communicated with the capture card. The user 
interface allowed control and monitoring of client connections. 
Client side, the server application, provided the anticipated result 
of  the  experiment.  It  was  documented  in  the  form  of  a  user’s 
manual and it provided both theoretical background and guidance. 
It  was  delivered  through  HTML  pages  in  Internet  Explorer, 
Mozilla  Firefox,  For  accuracy  of  the  movement  of  receptor,  the 
motor moves at a pitch of 7, 5 cm.

For  manipulation  of  the  experience,  students  can  first  choose  a 
position  of  the  receiver  and  click  ok,  automatically  the  receiver 
will  move  to  the  indicated  position,  and  the  result  will  be 
displayed  on  the  graph  next  to  it.  After  they  determine  the  time 
between  the  transmitter  and  receiver  signal  to  calculate  the 
velocity of sound. 
For example: 
We chose the position 2 which means that d = 30 cm  
And from the graph (Figure 10), T = 0.0009 s

The  students  browse  the  service  broker  to  register  and  request 
membership to the group associated with the laboratory. 
This  procedure  allows  permission  and  access  to  the  booking 
system,  and  then  they  choose  the  available  lab  experiment  to 
launch it. 

4.  CONCLUSION  

The  main  objective  of  this  project  was  to  create  an  effective 
remote laboratory network in the Maghreb region. 
This  work  presented  the  LabVIEW-based  realization  of  a  remote 
laboratories  dedicated  to  students  in  distance  e-sience  group  to 
enable  them  to  manipulate  and  control  in  real  time  the  deferent 
experiences. 
The  feasibility  of  accessing  a  remote  laboratory  from  a  simple 
Internet  browser  has  been  demonstrated.  This  concept 
is 
particularly  interesting  for  several  reasons  since  it  allows: 
eliminating 
through  affording 
flexibility,  affording  the  opportunity  for  conducting  an  online 
experiment  with  real  equipment  anytime  and  anywhere,  and  the 
sharing  of  scarce  and  expensive  resources  between  laboratories 
and educational institutions.
