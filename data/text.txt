First,  we  find  out  a  system  desire,  which  is  called  as  a  global
desire (Dg). To find out the global desire, we identify the system
belief, which is called as a global belief (Bg). We also identify a
system intention, which is called as a global intention (Ig). Next,
we decompose the global desire into several sub-level desires (Di)
to achieve with the agent system until we refine the goals of the
agent system  we  want  to  build.  For  each  desire,  we  can  identify
belief  (Bi)  and  also  intention  (Ii)  for  it.  We  call  this  a  series  of
desires  as  desire  lists  [Figure  2].  Through  this  step,  agent
decomposition [Figure 3] is succeeded.
